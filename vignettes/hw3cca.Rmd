# hw3cca

## Overview

The goal of hw3cca is to replicate some of the functionality of the existing R package. 
This is a simple method to calculate CCA. It is designed to calculate the CCA when the number of input X and Y columns is the same. The correlation generated is correct when the number of columns is different, but the number of rows or columns for the correlation coefficient will be different.

* `cca_simple()` calculate the simple Canonical Correlation.
* `cancor()` is R-build-in function to test whether the result is the same.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hw3cca from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r warning=FALSE}
# You can install it with vignettes
# devtools::install_github("lianchenglu/biostat625hw3")
devtools::install_github('lianchenglu/biostat625hw3',build_vignettes =T)
```

## Usage

In general, there are 4 steps to perform CCA by R

1.  Load the raw data

2.  Scale original data

3.  Canonical correlation analysis `simple_cca` (or `cancor`)

4.  Correlation coefficient significance test

Here, I generate data randomly. The result of `cca_simple` and `cancor` is the same.  There are two canonical correlation coefficients. `xcoef` is coefficient for x variables so this is linear combination coefficients. `ycoef` is coefficient for y variables so this is linear combination coefficients.

```{r setup}
library(hw3cca)
## basic example code
set.seed(123)
x1 <- matrix(rnorm(20000), 10000, 2)
y1 <- matrix(rnorm(20000), 10000, 2)
cca_simple(x1, y1)
cancor(x1, y1)[1:3]
```

Similarly, you can gernerate a bigger dataset.

```{r}
x2 <- matrix(rnorm(2000000), 400000, 5)
y2 <- matrix(rnorm(2000000), 400000, 5)
cca_simple(x2, y2)[1]
cancor(x2, y2)[1]
```

## Test
Comparison against the original R functions on simulated datasets to demonstrate both the correctness (e.g., via all.equal()) 

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(testthat)
test_that("cca_simple function", {
  expect_equal(cca_simple(x1, y1), cancor(x1, y1)[1:3], tolerance = 0.0001)
})
```

The efficiency of the implemented functions.

```{r}
bench::mark(
  cca_simple(x1, y1),
  cancor(x1,y1)[1:3],
  iterations = 10,
  check = TRUE
)

```
